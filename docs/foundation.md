# Deploying Solutions to an enterprise-ready foundation

The technical prerequisites for the Enterprise Knowledge Solution are self-contained in the deployment guide of this repository. However, in large and complex enterprise environments, you might expect additional controls that go beyond the scope of this repository. For example, you might expect to sync users from your existing identity provider to Google Cloud, to enforce preventative controls against insecure cloud resource configurations, or export audit logs for all projects to an aggregated destination.

We recommend addressing this broad set of requirements through designing a cloud foundation (sometimes called a "landing zone"). A cloud foundation is the baseline of resources, configurations, and capabilities that enable companies to adopt Google Cloud for their business needs. A well-designed foundation enables consistent governance, security controls, scale, visibility, and access to shared services across all workloads in your Google Cloud environment.

Google Cloud provides guidance on how to design and implement these controls through the [Enterprise Foundation Blueprint](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations). You can use the enterprise foundation blueprint in one of two days:

- **New customers to GCP**: quickly deploy a foundation with premade assets, to reduce the time and effort spent on planning and building the foundation. This helps accelerate the time to your first meaningful workload that provides business value.
- **Existing customers on GCP**: assess your existing environment against the recommended foundation capabilities. Where you have gaps, iterate on your existing foundation to improve controls and governance for your workloads.

Both approaches can help identify the set of capabilities that help you deploy and use the Enterprise Knowledge Solution in a way that meets enterprise best practices.

## Enterprise security controls

The foundation blueprint addresses a range of enterprise requirements, including common platform-wide security controls that go beyond the scope of any individual workload.
The following capabilities are common security controls you might expect to meet before deploying and using this Solution:
