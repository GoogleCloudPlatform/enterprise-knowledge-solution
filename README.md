# Enterprise Knowledge Solution (EKS)

This repository contains the source code to implement the Enterprise Knowledge Solution (EKS) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The solution is composed of modular components that collectively enable the creation of end-to-end workflow for document processing, management and analysis:

* **Document Ingestion:** Upload and import a variety of document types.
* **Document Processing:** Validate, extract information, and transform document content.
* **Document Storage:** Securely store and manage processed documents.
* **Document Indexing:** Enabling efficient search and retrieval of document information.
* **Search and Summarization:**  Search and summarization of document content.
* **Document Retrieval:** Access to the original document files.

## Components
The solution comprises the following key components:

| Component | Description |
| -------------------------- | - |
| [Document Processing](components/processing/README.md) | Python tools and deployments for executing document processing tasks (extraction, transformation, enrichment). |
| [Common Infrastructure](components/common-infra/README.md) | Provides the shared infrastructure foundation for the EKS (networking, storage, datasets etc.). |
| [Workflow Orchestrator](components/dpu-workflow/README.md) | Orchestrates the end-to-end document processing workflow using Cloud Composer. |
| [Web UI](components/webui/README.md) | Offers a user interface for interacting with the EKS (search, summarization, document views etc). |

## Deployment Guide
This section provides a step-by-step instructions on how to deploy the `Enterprise Knowledge Solution` on Google Cloud using Terraform.

### Prerequisites
To deploy this solution, you need:
- A [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview#projects) with billing enabled.
- An account with the [Project Owner role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#resource-manager-roles) on the project. This grants the necessary permissions to create and manage resources.
- An account with the [Organization Policy Admin](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/creating-managing-policies) role assigned within the organization, which is required to modify the following organization policies:
    * `compute.vmExternalIpAccess`
    * `compute.requireShieldedVm`
    * `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`

    These modifications enable public IP access for the Web-UI interface while securing it through Identity Aware Proxy (IAP). If policy adjustments are not possible, you can opt to exclude the Web-UI component during deployment by setting the Terraform variable `deploy_ui` to `false`. Alternatively, you can deploy the Web-UI locally by referring to the instructions in the [Deploy Locally](./components/webui/README.md#deploy-locally) section.

- You need a [Document AI Custom Document Classifier]() in your GCP Project. You can create a [Custom Document Classifier in the Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/custom-classifier).

- You can use the [test documents and forms](sample-deployments/composer-orchestrated-process/documents-for-testing/forms-to-train-docai) to train and evaluate the classifier in your GCP environment.

- We have created an annotated dataset to expedite the training process. Please contact your Google account representative to get access to the annotated dataset.

- You must deploy the customer classifier and mark it as a default version for the Cloud Composer workflow to detect it and use.

### Deploying the Sample
1. Open [Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell)
1. Clone this repository
1. Navigate to the Sample Directory:

    ```sh
    cd <YOUR_REPOSITORY>/sample-deployments/composer-orchestrated-process
    ```
    Where `<YOUR_REPOSITORY>` is the path to the directory where you cloned this repository.

1. Set environment variable: `PROJECT_ID`

    ```sh
    export PROJECT_ID="<your Google Cloud project id>"
    export REGION="<Google Cloud Region for deploying the resources>"
    export DOC_AI_REGION="<Doc AI region where your Custom Document Classifier is deployed.>"
    export DOC_AI_PROCESSOR_ID="<ID for the Custom Document Classifier>"
    ```
1. Run the following script to setup your environment and your cloud project for running terraform:

    ```sh
    scripts/pre_tf_setup.sh
    ```
1. Initialize Terraform:

    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```
1. Create a terraform.tfvars file if it does not exist. Initialize the following Terraform variables in terraform.tfvars file:

        project_id                  = # Your Google Cloud project ID.

        region                      = # The desired region for deploying resources (e.g., "us-central1", "europe-west1").

        vertex_ai_data_store_region = # The region for your Agent Builder Data Store, the possible values are ("global", "us", or "eu"). Choose a region the is align with you overal region of choice to avoid cross regional traffic.

        docai_location              = # Sets the location for Document AI service

        iap_admin_account           = # Account used for manage Oath brand and IAP

        iap_access_domains          = # List of domains granted for IAP access to the web-ui (e.g., ["domain:google.com","domain:example.com"])

        deploy_ui                   = # Toggler for the Web-UI component, boolean value true or false. If the scripts/pre_tf_setup.sh failed to set the required org-policies set this variable to false.

        webui_service_name          = # set this to "default" for the first run and change it if you intend to have a different service name for your App.

1. Review the proposed changes, and apply them:

    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```
    The provisioning process may take about 30 minutes to complete.

### Update your environment with new code/new version
If you update the source code or pull the latest changes from the repository, re-run the following command to apply the changes to your deployed environment:

```sh
terraform apply
```
