gcloud config set project $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT

gcloud artifacts repositories create "$AR_REPO" --location="$AR_REPO_LOCATION" --repository-format=Docker

gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com

```

Build the app and save it in the Artifact repository

```commandline
./build.sh
```

Deploy the app from the Artifact repository to Cloud Run

```commandline
./deploy.sh
```

Test locally using Cloud Run proxy

```commandline
./run_proxy.sh
