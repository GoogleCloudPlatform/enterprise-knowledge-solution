# EKS Document Workflow Orchestrator

This module provisons the resources required to run the EKS document workflow orchestrator. The document workflow is a airflow DAG running on Cloud Composer.
The orchestrator carries out the following task for the processing of the ingested documents in EKS.

- Move the ingested documents from the cloud storage input bucket to process bucket
- Creates folders in cloud storage process bucket and reject bucket for the current workflow run
- Creates a BigQuery table for the current workflow run
- Starts the EKS doc-processer job on Cloud Run to process the ingested documents
- Import the processed document into Vertex AI Agent Builder data store

## Resource Created

Following resource are provsioned and created when the module are applied through terraform:
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| VPC Subnet | A VPC subnet in the common EKS VPC network. The VPC subnet has secondary IP ranges dedicated the the Cloud Composer environment |
| Cloud Composer environmet `dpu-composer` | A Cloud Composer environment for execution of the document workflow orchestrator |
| Document Workflow DAG | The document workflow DAG source code deployed in to the Cloud Composer DAG bucket, ready for EKS users to run |
| Workflow Service Account | Dedicated service accout used in the workflow execution with the neccessary access right needed to GCS bucket, BigQuery dataset, Cloud Run and Vertex AI Agent builder |
