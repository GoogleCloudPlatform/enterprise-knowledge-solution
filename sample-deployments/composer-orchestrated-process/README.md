# EKS Cloud Composer orchestrated document processing

In this directory, you can find an end-to-end example deployment of the Enterprise Knowledge Solution (EKS) on Google Cloud.

The components of EKS can be deployed individually or as part of a custom setup. The [`main.tf`](./main.tf) file demonstrates how to configure and deploy each component using Terraform.

## Additional Resources

In additional to the EKS components this example also deployes the following resources:
